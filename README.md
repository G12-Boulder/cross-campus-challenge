#Hello and welcome!
To pit algo1 vs algo2, run node runner.js ./algo1.js ./algo2.js in a terminal.

The algos play against eachother 1000 times, and the games counted and printed to the console at the end of the run.

See brapp.js, andapp.js, random.js and skynet.js for examples on how to pass functions into runner.js to be invoked.
