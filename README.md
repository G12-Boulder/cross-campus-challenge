# Cross Campus Challenge
You're either first or your last.
###Fork and Clone. You know what to do.

###Rules

There are two players (one player, one AI).
Each player writes a number, hidden from the other player. It can be any integer 1 through 10. Players can only use each number once!
The players reveal their numbers.
Whoever chose the lower number gets 1 point, unless the lower number is lower by only 1, then the player with the higher number gets 2 points
If they both chose the same number, neither player gets a point.
This repeats, and the game ends when one player has 5 points.
The challenge is to write a script to play this game. Knowing the rules and all your opponent's previous numbers, can you program a strategy? You should really try playing this first with your friends â€” you'll see there's a deep human element to predicting your opponent's choice. Is it possible to program a strong strategy?

###Requirements

Create an algorithm for the AI by EOD Monday - 1 submission per cohort!
Instructors will test and determine the winner
